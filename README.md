# UART_Protocol
This Protocol mainly implements the UART protocol
 UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) code typically used in SoC (System on Chip) design using Verilog HDL, which is a common choice in hardware description and digital design.
 Featuires of UART:
 
 1. UART is used for serial communication (usually RS-232).
 2. Sends data bit by bit from the Tx (transmit) line.
 3. Receives data bit-by-bit from the Rx (receive) line.
 4. Common parameters: baud rate, data bits, parity, and stop bits.
